Suitable for tourists who are at point A and want to reach point B and on the way to visit tourist sites along the way.

I and four other friends from the school built a website suitable for tourists who are abroad and want to get from
point A to point B and on the way to enjoy some other tourist sites without wasting too much time and fuel.

We used JavaScript, PHP, CSS, HTML, and SQL programming languages. Confirm all languages we have learned alone.
Except for SQL, which we studied in school.

We also used the project in API implementations such as the AutoComplete API and the creation of a route from A to B API.
